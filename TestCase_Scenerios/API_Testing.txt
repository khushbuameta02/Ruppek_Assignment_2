1> Test scenarios to test these APIs
    a) Authenticate API
	> Functional Testing : 
		> Post correct username and password. Check if it generates a token.
		> Send random bearer token value too alongwith POST request.
	> Neagtive Testing:
		> Send blank username and check that auth fails.
		> Send wrong username and check that auth fails.
		> Do not send "username" field in body and check that auth fails.
		> Send blank password and check that auth fails.
		> Send wrong password and check that auth fails.
		> Do not send "password" field in body and check that auth fails.
		> Send additional JSON fields and check that auth works.
		> Check if SQL injection can hamper security.
	> Performance/Load testing
		> Repeatedly post token request and check that its not hung.
		> Check validaity of a token after same username generates another token.

    b) Users API
	> Functional Testing:
		> Send request and check all records are displayed or not.
		> Check for number of records and record data as per database.
		> Check output of request when there is no data in database.
	> Negative testing
		> Send wrong Auth token.
		> Send random body fields.
	> Performance/Load testing
		> Keep sending GET requests, and add a new user while GET requests are being sent.
		> Send multiple GET and test for equality of records eveytime.

    c) Find User API
	> Functional Testing :
		> Check if correct phone number results in correct user data being printed.
		> Check if multiple users have same phone number, all results are displayed.
	> Negative Testing :
		> Send request for non existing phone number
		> Send request with wrong auth token
		> Send request for non numberic input
		> Send extra fields in body


2> Execute test cases and document defects and suggestions.
    a) Authenticate API
	> API returns proper token when username and passwor dis given
	> Suggestion : Proper error message can be returned back, saying "username/password" is wrong or absent when authentication fails.
    b) Users API
	> API returns data of all 3 users.
	> Suggestions : There should be capability to set output format.
	> Body of request should have capability to set/unset which fields should be returned
    c) User search API
	> API returned proper search result
	> Suggestions : Even when user is not found, STATUS_OK is received. That too, without any data.
	> We can either send message "No users found" or send and error status.
